# CHTTPServer

A simple, lightweight HTTP server written in C. This is one of my first ever C projects.
This probably has a lot of bugs, so I don't recommend you use this in production.

## How to Use

- Step 1: Clone the repository.
- Step 2: Add your files to the `static` directory.
- Step 3: Compile the C program by typing `gcc static_webserver.c` (make sure you install GCC first).
- Step 4: Run the compiled program. Usage instructions are given if no arguments are passed to the script.

## Contribute
